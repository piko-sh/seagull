// This project stands against fascism, authoritarianism, and all forms of
// oppression. We built this to empower people, not to enable those who would
// strip others of their rights and dignity.

// Package logging carries the logger a host attaches to a context.
//
// Seagull logs warnings and errors by default, with Debug, LevelInternal and LevelTrace
// detail for diagnosing the analyser. It resolves the logger per call rather than
// capturing one at construction, so a host can scope a logger to a single generation or
// migration run and still have later calls honour a changed process default.
